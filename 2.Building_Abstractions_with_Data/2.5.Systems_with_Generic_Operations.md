# 2.5 Systems with Generic Operations

- In the previous section, we presented how we can build generic arithmetic operations over different representations for complex numbers.
- Now we go beyond that and build generic arithmetic operations that operate on any type of numbers (e.g. ordinary numbers, rational numbers, and complex numbers). Moreover, we want to build the system in an additive style so that each package can be built separately and adapting new type of numbers should not require refactoring existing code.
- Here is a system design to the system we're going to build

```

                                  Programs that use numbers

          ---------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------
```

## 2.5.1 Generic Arithmetic Operations

- we shall use **data directed** programming to design our system:

  1. Let's start by defining generic arithmetic operations:

  ```
  (define (add x y)
    (apply-generic 'add x y))

  (define (sub x y)
    (apply-generic 'sub x y))

  (define (mul x y)
    (apply-generic 'mul x y))

  (define (div x y)
    (apply-generic 'div x y))
  ```

  Note that we need to define another version of `apply-generic` that works with arbitrary number of arguments cuz the one we defined before was defined to operate on one argument.

  2. Install ordinary numbers arithmetic package. We will use the symbol `scheme-number` to tag ordinary numbers.

  ```
  (define (install-scheme-number-package)
    (define (tag x) (attatch-tag 'scheme-number x))
    (put 'add '(scheme-number scheme-number)
         (lamda (x y) (tag (+ x y))))
    (put 'sub '(scheme-number scheme-number)
         (lamda (x y) (tag (- x y))))
    (put 'mul '(scheme-number scheme-number)
         (lamda (x y) (tag (* x y))))
    (put 'div '(scheme-number scheme-number)
         (lamda (x y) (tag (/ x y)))))
    (put 'make 'scheme-number
         (lamda (x) (tag x)))
    'done)
  ```

  Users can create tagged scheme numbers using this procedure

  ```
  (define (make-scheme-number x)
    ((get 'make 'scheme-number) x))
  ```

  3. Install rational numbers arithmetic package

  ```
  (define (install-rational-package)
    ;; internal procedures
    (define (numer x) (car x))
    (define (denom x) (cdr x))
    (define (make-rat n d)
      (let ((g (gcd n d)))
        (cons (/ n g) (/ d g))))
    (define (add-rat x y)
      (make-rat (+ (* (numer x) (denom y))
                  (* (numer y) (denom x)))
                (* (denom x) (denom y))))
    (define (sub-rat x y)
      (make-rat (- (* (numer x) (denom y))
                  (* (numer y) (denom x)))
                (* (denom x) (denom y))))
    (define (mul-rat x y)
      (make-rat (* (numer x) (numer y))
                (* (denom x) (denom y))))
    (define (div-rat x y)
      (make-rat (* (numer x) (denom y))
                (* (denom x) (numer y))))

    ;; interface to rest of the system
    (define (tag x) (attach-tag ’rational x))
    (put ’add ’(rational rational)
        (lambda (x y) (tag (add-rat x y))))
    (put ’sub ’(rational rational)
        (lambda (x y) (tag (sub-rat x y))))
    (put ’mul ’(rational rational)
        (lambda (x y) (tag (mul-rat x y))))
    (put ’div ’(rational rational)
        (lambda (x y) (tag (div-rat x y))))
    (put ’make ’rational
        (lambda (n d) (tag (make-rat n d))))
    ’done)

  ```

  ```
  (define (make-rational n d)
     ((get ’make ’rational) n d))
  ```

  4. Install complex arithmetic package

  ```
  (define (install-complex-package)
    ;; imported procedures from rectangular and polar packages
    (define (make-from-real-imag x y)
      ((get ’make-from-real-imag ’rectangular) x y))
    (define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
      ((get ’make-from-mag-ang ’polar) r a))

    ;; internal procedures
    (define (add-complex z1 z2)
      (make-from-real-imag (+ (real-part z1) (real-part z2))
                          (+ (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))
    (define (sub-complex z1 z2)
      (make-from-real-imag (- (real-part z1) (real-part z2))
                          (- (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))
    (define (mul-complex z1 z2)
      (make-from-mag-ang (* (magnitude z1) (magnitude z2))
                        (+ (angle z1) (angle z2))))
    (define (div-complex z1 z2)
      (make-from-mag-ang (/ (magnitude z1) (magnitude z2))
                        (- (angle z1) (angle z2))))

    ;; interface to rest of the system
    (define (tag z) (attach-tag ’complex z))
    (put ’add ’(complex complex)
        (lambda (z1 z2) (tag (add-complex z1 z2))))
    (put ’sub ’(complex complex)
        (lambda (z1 z2) (tag (sub-complex z1 z2))))
    (put ’mul ’(complex complex)
        (lambda (z1 z2) (tag (mul-complex z1 z2))))
    (put ’div ’(complex complex)
        (lambda (z1 z2) (tag (div-complex z1 z2))))
    (put ’make-from-real-imag ’complex
        (lambda (x y) (tag (make-from-real-imag x y))))
    (put ’make-from-mag-ang ’complex
        (lambda (r a) (tag (make-from-mag-ang r a))))
    ’done)
  ```

  ```
  (define (make-complex-from-real-imag x y)
    ((get ’make-from-real-imag ’complex) x y))
  (define (make-complex-from-mag-ang r a)
    ((get ’make-from-mag-ang ’complex) r a))
  ```

### Exercise 2.78

```
(define (type-tag x)
  (if (number? x)
      'scheme-number
      (car x)))

(define (contents x)
  (if (number? x)
      (x)
      (cdr x)))

(define (attach-tag type contents)
  (if (equal? type 'scheme-number)
      (contents)
      (cons type contents)))
```

### Exercise 2.79

```
(define (equ? x y)
  (apply-generic 'equ? x y))


; complex
(define (complex-equ? x y)
  (and (equ? (real-part x) (real-part y))
       (equ? (imag-part x) (imag-part y))))

(put 'equ? '(complex complex) complex-equ?)

; rational
(define (rational-equ? x y)
  (and (equ? (nemor x) (nemor y))
       (equ? (denom x) (denom y))))

(put 'equ? '(rational rational) rational-equ?)

; scheme
(define (scheme-equ? x y)
  (equal? x y))

(put 'equ? '(scheme-number scheme-number) scheme-equ?)
```

## 2.5.2 Combining Data of Different Types

- Till now we managed to build a system that not only builds horizontal abstraction bariers between layers of the program but also builds vertical abstraction bariers between different types that the operations can operate on. And what's cool is that we built it in an additive style which means supporting new types of data is done by just installing a new package to the system without refactoring things.

- What we did not discuss is how are we going to provide **cross-type** operations. We need our system to be able to add a **complex number** to a **regular number** since this is a valid operation. The naive approach that we can easily follow is installing procedures for all possible pairs of data types. So for adding a **complex number** to a **regular number**, we might add this procedure:

```
;; to be included in the complex package
(define (add-complex-to-schemenum z x)
  (make-from-real-imag (+ (real-part z) x)
                      (imag-part z)))

(put ’add ’(complex scheme-number)
    (lambda (z x) (tag (add-complex-to-schemenum z x))))
```

while this is a valid solution but it becomes cumbersome to add a procedure for all possible pairs of data types and what's really important is that it breaks the program additivity since supporting a new data type is not only meant to add its related procedures but we need to add cross-type operations.

### Coercion

- Another intuitive way of dealing with this problem is **coercion**. Usually when you're adding a regular number to a complex number, you would think of the regular number as a complex number with the imaginary part equal to zero. This is **coercion**. You convert an object from a data type to another to be able to operate on both of them in a uniform way.

- We can use the same approach here. We will maintain a new table for **coercion**(suppose we have these procedures available `put-coercion` and `get-coercion`) and use this table inside the `apply-generic` procedure so that it will be like this:

1. first look for the procedure in the old table. If it is found, then apply it
2. If such a procedure not found then try to look for a procedure to coerce the first arg to the type of the second arg. If it is found then use it. If not try the other way.
3. If all the above fails, then we cannot handle this operation

- For example we can build a procedure for converting regular numbers to complex numbers

```
(define (scheme-number->complex x)
  (make-complex-from-real-imag (contents x) 0))
```

Then we can add thie procedure to the table

```
(put-coercion ’scheme-number ’complex scheme-number->complex)
```

- Usually the **coercion** table will have some empty slots since not every type can be converted to all types. for example, an arbitrary complex number can not be converted to a regular number.

- Now we can refactor `apply-generic` procedure

```
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)) (proc (get op type-tags)))
       (if proc
           (proc (map contents args))
           (let
            ((t1 (car type-tags))
             (t2 (cadr type-tags))
             (a1 (car args))
             (a2 (cadr args)))
             (let
              ((t1->t2 (get-coercion t1 t2))
               (t2->t1 (get-coercion t2 t1)))
              ((cond
                (t1->t2 (apply-generic op (t1->t2 a1) a2))
                (t2-t1 (apply-generic op a1 (t2->t1 a2)))
                (else error "No op"))))))))
```

### Hierarchies of types

- **Coercion** relies on the fact that there are relations between different data types. Usually there is a more general structure of the types. For the arithmetic system, we can view data types as:

  - An integer is a special kind of a rational number
  - A rational number is a special kind of a real number
  - A real number is a special kind of a complex number

- What we are describing here is called a **tower** structure. Each type in the system might have at most one supertype and one subtype.

- What's cool here is that we can define `raise` procedure to transform a type to its supertype and `lower` to reduce a type to its subtype when possible.

- `raise` operation can be used in `apply-generic` procedure when attempting to apply an operation on different types. We can `raise` objects until we end up with objects at the same level hence we can carry out the operation.

- `lower` operation can be very useful in getting natural results. Suppose that you're adding those complex numbers `(3 + 4i), (5 - 4i)`. It would be nice to get the result as the integer `8` instead of the complex number `(8 + 0i)`.

### Inadequacies of hierarchies

- Not all systems can be viewed as a **tower** structure. Consider a system modeling the geometric figures. In such a system, data types can have more than one subtype and more than on supertype. This results in complicating the `raise` and `lower` operations since you do not have one choice where to go.

#### Exercise 2.82

```
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (define (signal-error type-tags)
    (error "No method for these types - APPLY-GENERIC"
            (list op type-tags)))

  (define (coerce-types tags args)
    (coerce-types-iter tags args tags))

  (define (coerce-types-iter tags args remaining-tags)
    (cond ((null? remaining-tags) (signal-error tags))
          ((can-be-coerced? tags (car remaining-tags)) (apply-generic op (apply-coercion args (car remaining-tags))))
          (coerce-types-iter tags args (cdr remaining-tags))))

  (define (can-be-coerced? tags tag)
    (cond ((null? tags) true)
          ((get-coercion (car tags) tag) (can-be-coerced? (cdr tags) tag))
          (false)))

  (define (apply-coercion args tag)
    (map (lamda
            (arg)
            ((get-coercion (type-tag arg) tag) arg))
         args))

  (let* ((type-tags (map type-tag args))
          (proc (get op type-tags)))
    (if proc
        (apply proc (map contents args))
        (coerce-types type-tags args))))
```
