# 2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction

- **Data abstraction** is about designing modular programs in which the parts that use data are independent from the ones that define and represent data concretely. In order to do that, we need to design the parts that use data to make no assumptions about how data is represented and cares only about **what** it needs from data. This can be done by defining an interface between those 2 parts of the program through defining 2 types of procedures: **constructors**(for creating data objects) and **selectors**(for accessing different parts of data objects). It's crucial that changing how data objects are represented should have no effect on the parts that use those data objects as long as the new representation has the same interface of **constructors** and **selectors** with the same behaviour of the previous representation.

## 2.1.1 Example: Arithmetic Operations for Rational Numbers

- Let's define arithmetic operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and equality) for rational numbers. Suppose that we have procedures to create a rational number, select its numerator, and select its denominator defined:

```
- (make-rat <n> <d>) returns rational number x whose numerator=<a> and denominator=<d>
- (numer <x>) returns numerator of rational number <x>
- (denom <x>) returns denominator of rational number <x>
```

- We can build rational number operations in terms of these 3 procedures:

```
(define (add-rat x y)
  (make-rat (+ (* (numer x) (denom y))
               (* (numer y) (denom x)))
            (* (denom x) (denom y))))
```

```
(define (sub-rat x y)
  (make-rat (- (* (numer x) (denom y))
               (* (numer y) (denom x)))
            (* (denom x) (denom y))))
```

```
(define (mul-rat x y)
  (make-rat (* (numer x) (numer y))
            (* (denom x) (denom y))))
```

```
(define (div-rat x y)
  (make-rat (* (numer x) (denom y))
            (* (denom x) (numer y))))
```

```
(define (equal-rat? x y)
  (= (* (numer x) (denom y))
     (* (numer y) (denom x))))
```

- We are leveraging a powerful methodolgy named **wishful thinking** by supposing the procedures representing rational numbers exist and building on top of them

### Pairs

- **Lisp** provides a way to create compound data objects through **pairs** which a data structure for creating objects of 2 parts. **Lisp** provides 3 primitive procedures for dealing with **pairs**:

```
- (cons <a> <b>) creates a pair <x> of 2 parts a and b
- (car <x>) selects part <a> of a pair <x>
- (cdr <x>) selects part <b> of a pair <x>
```

For example:

```
(define x (cons 1 2))

(car x)
1

(cdr x)
2
```

- **Pairs** can also be composed of **pairs**:

```
(define x (cons 1 2))

(define y (cons 3 4))

(define z (cons x y))

(car (car z))
1

(cdr (car z))
2
```

- **Pairs** can be used as building blocks to create all sort of complec data structures.

### Representing rational numbers

- Now we can use **pairs** to represent rational numbers:

```
(define (make-rat n d) (cons n d))

(define (numer x) (car x))

(define (denom x) (cdr x))
```

- We can also define a procedure for pretty printing a rational number:

```
(define (print-rat x)
  (new line)
  (display (numer x))
  (display "/")
  (display (denom x)))
```

```
(define (one-half) (make-rat 1 2))

(define (one-third) (make-rat 1 3))

(print-rat (add-rat one-third one-third))
6/9
```

- You notice that our representation of rational numbers does not do reduction. We can redefine `make-rat` to address this issues through the use of **greatest common divisor**

```
(define (make-rat n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d)))
    (cons (/ n g) (/ d g))))
```

```
(print-rat (add-rat one-third one-third))
2/3
```

Notice that we refactored our representation of rational numbers without the need to touch the procedures that use such representation. Thanks to **data abstraction**

#### Exercise 2.1

```
(define (negative? x) (< x 0))
```

```
(define (make-rat n d)
  (cond ((and (negative? n) (negative? d))
        (cons (- n) (- d))
        (and (!negative? n) (!negative? d))
        (cons n d)
        (negative? n)
        (cons n d)
        (negative? d)
        (cons (- n) (- d))))
```

simplified:

```
(define (make-rat n d)
  (cond (negative? d)
        (cons (- n) (- d))
        (else (cons n d))))
```

## 2.1.2 Abstraction Bariers

- The basic idea of **data abstraction** is to identify for each type of data objects the basic set of operations that can cover all type of manipulations on this type of data objects(creation and accessing) and to use this set of operations in the program parts that use this type of data objects. This set of operations represents the interface to this type of data objects and this interface should not depened on the way this type of data objects is represented which enables us to change this representation implementation details without the need to change the program parts that use this type of data objects as long as the interface acts the same as before. This helps us designing modular programs that are easy to maintain.

- Looking back at our implementation of rational numbers system. Thanks to **data abstraction**, we could separate the program into loosely coupled modules. The horizontal lines represent **abstraction bariers** between those parts of the program:
  - **problem domain** part needs to only care about the rational numbers arithmetic operations `add-rat`, `sub-rat`, `mul-rat`, `div-rat`, and `equal-rat?` without the need to know any underlying details.
  - The rational numbers arithmetic operations are implemented only in terms `make-rat`, `numer`, and `denom` which is the rational number data objects interface. But these arithmetic operations knows nothing about the representation implementation details of rational numbers data objects. It only cares about the interface.
  - The interface is built through `pairs` which **Lisp** provides.

```
                  +------------------------------------+
          --------| Programs that use rational numbers |--------
                  +------------------------------------+
                    Rational numbers in promblem domain
                      +---------------------------+
          ------------|   add-rat  sub-rat  ...   |-------------
                      +---------------------------+

                        +------------------------+
                        Rational numbers as pairs

                            +----------------+
                      However pairs are implemented
```

- Remember when we wanted to reduce the rational numbers, we did this in the **construction step** in `make-rat` procedure. An alternate way is to do that in the **access step**:

```
(define (make-rat n d) (cons n d))

(define (numer x)
  (let ((g (gcd (car x) (cdr x))))
       (/ (car x) g)))

(define (denom x)
  (let ((g (gcd (car x) (cdr x))))
       (/ (cdr x) g)))
```

This is might be useful if we are accessing the `numer` and `denom` rarely. Designing the system with **data abstraction** in mind, enabled us to change the representation implementation details of the rational number data objects without affecting other parts of the system and also it gives us the ability to defer that decision of computing the `gcd` at the construction or the accessing step to later time and complete building other parts of the system.

#### Exercise 2.2

```
(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))
```

```
(define (midpoint-segment segment)
  (make-point (average (x-point (start-segment segment))
                       (x-point (end-segment segment)))
              (average (y-point (start-segment segment))
                       (y-point (end-segment segment)))))

(define (make-segment start-point end-point) (cons start-point end-point))

(define (start-segment segment) (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment) (cdr segment))

(define (make-point x y) (cons x y))

(define (x-point point) (car point))

(define (y-point point) (cdr point))
```

#### Exercise 2.3

```
(define (make-rect l w) (cons l w))

(define (length-rect r) (car r))

(define (width-rect r) (dcr r))

(define (area-rect r) (* (length-rect r) (width-rect r)))

(define (perimeter-rect r) (* 2 (+ (length-rect r) (width-rect r))))
```

Another representation for rectangle data objects:

```
(define (x-diff-segment segment) (- (x-point (end-segment segment)) (x-point (start-segment segment))))

(define (y-diff-segment segment) (- (y-point (end-segment segment)) (y-point (start-segment segment))))

(define (make-rect l w)
  (cons (make-segment (make-point 0 0)
                      (make-point l 0))
        (make-segment (make-point 0 0)
                      (make-point 0 w))))

(define (length-rect r) (x-diff-segment (car r)))

(define (width-rect r) (y-diff-segment (dcr r)))
```

## 2.1.3 What Is Meant by Data?

- In the previous chanpter, when we treated **procedures as objects** that can be named by a variable, passed as an argument, and returned as a value, the distinction between data and procedures began to blur. Because we treat procedures the same as data objects. In this section we will see how we can represent data objects themselves using only procedures and this will totally blur the distinction.

- First what is meant by data? actually the answer is not quite easy. Consider the **rational number** data objects we represented in the previous section. This type of data objects is defined in terms of 3 procedures `make-rat`, `numer`, and `denom`. But not every arbitrary 3 procedures can define this type of data objects. In fact, there is a **condition** that those 3 procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid representation of **rational numbers**. The condition is that for a **rational number** `x` constructed using `(make-rat n d)`, then

```

(numer x)    n
--------- = ---
(denom x)    d
```

- This also applies to the **Lisp** primitive data object **pair**. The 3 procedures must fulfill the condition that for any pair `x` constructed using `(cons a b)`, then

```
(car x) = a

(cdr x) = b
```

- We did not care how **pair** is implemented in **Lisp** and we should not. But in order ro blure the distinction between data and procedures, let's see how we can implement **pair** using only procedures. Consider this implementation to the 3 procedures that fulffil the stated condition:

```
(define (cons a b)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((= m 0) a)
          ((= m 1) b)
          (else (error "Argument not 0 or 1 -- CONS" m))))
  dispatch)

(define (car x) (x 0))

(define (cdr x) (x 1))
```

If we tried those defined procedures:

```
(define x (cons 1 2))

(car x)
1

(cdr x)
2
```

- This paradigm is known as **message passing**.

#### Exercise 2.4

```
(define (cdr z)
  (z (lambda (p q) q)))
```

#### Exercise 2.5

```
(define (cons a b) (* (expt 2 a) (expt 3 b)))

(define (car x)
  (max-div-count x 2))

(define (cdr x)
  (max-div-count x 3))

(define (max-div-count divident divisor)
  (define (max-div-count-iter divident divisor count)
    (if (= (remainder divident divisor) 0)
        (max-div-count-iter (/ divident divisor) divisor (+ count 1))
        count))
  (max-div-count-iter divident divisor 0)
```

## 2.1.4 Extended Exercise: Interval Arithmetic

- We're going to design a system that manipulates inexact quantities such as measures of physical devices with known precision. This system can be used to calculate the equivalent parallel resistor of 2 resistors. Since a resistor has a value and a precision based on the manufacturer like 10-owm 10% so this resistor value must be in the range 10 - 0.1 _ 10 = 9 and 10 + 0.1 _ 10 = 11. The idea is to design a system to manipulate intervals so given those 2 intervals (9, 11) and (18, 22) we can add those intervals to get (27, 33).

- We will preasume that we have an abstract object `interval` such that an interval `x` with lower bound `a` and upper bound `b` can be constructed through contructor procedure `(make-interval a b)` and the lower bound `a` can be accessed through selector procedure `lower-bound x` and the upper bound `b` can be accessed through selector procedure `upper-bound x`.

- Then we cn build those operations in terms of the 3 mentioned procedures:

```
(define (add-interval x y)
  (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                 (+ (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
```

```
(define (mul-interval x y)
  (let ((p1 (* (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y)))
        (p2 (* (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y)))
        (p3 (* (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y)))
        (p4 (* (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
    (make-interval (Min p1 p2 p3 p4)
                   (Max p1 p2 p3 p4))))
```

```
(define (div-interval x y)
  (mul-interval x
                (make-interval (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y))
                               (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y)))))
```

#### Exercise 2.7

```
(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))
```

```
(define (lower-bound i) (car i))

(define (upper-bound i) (cdr i))
```

#### Exercise 2.8

```
(define (sub-interval x y)
  (make-interval (- (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y))
                 (+ (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y))))
```
