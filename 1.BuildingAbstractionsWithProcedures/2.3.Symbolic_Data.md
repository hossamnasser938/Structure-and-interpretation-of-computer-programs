# 2.3 Symbolic Data

- So far we have been constructing data objects whose parts are only primitive numbers. Now we introduce the ability to model arbitrary symbols. This is very useful when it comes to modeling people's names for example. So we need to be able to construct `person` object for example:

```
(make-person Mohamed 26)
```

where `make-person` is a constructor procedure that accepts person's name as the 1st arg and person's age as the 2nd arg.

## 2.3.1 Quotation

- But how our language will differentiate between `Mohamed` as an arbitrary character string and `Mohamed` as an expression with a value because you might have an expression in the environment name `Mohamed`:

```
(define Mohamed 10)
```

- This is a well known issue in the natural language where there is a confusion between words being used semantically(meaning) and syntactically(arbitrary character strings). Suppose that you read this sentence in a story: `Hey, Say your name!`, what you expect to hear is a person's name. Now suppose you read this sentence `Hey, Say "your name"!`, what you expect to hear is "your name" literally. Why is this? because in then atural language, we usually use **quotation** to mean **syntactically**(literally). We adopt this convention as well in **LISP** where we use quotation to refer to arbitrary symbols not expressions. In **LISP**, we use only single quotes at the start of the word. So now we can do something like this:

```
(make-person 'Mohamed 26)
```

Now the compiler will not get confused whether `Mohamed` means `Mohamed` literally or it is an expression that must be evaluated.

```
(define a 1)

(define b 2)

(list a b)
(1 2)

(list 'a 'b)
(a b)

(list a 'b)
(1 b)
```

- we can use also the single quote to construct lists:

```
(list 1 2 3)
(1 2 3)

`(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
```

- Now we can dispense with `nil`

```
`()
()

nil
()
```

- **LISP** provides a primitive procedure `eq?` for testing whether 2 symbols are the same or not:

```
(eq? 'a 'a)
true
```

- Now we can use `eq?` to build another procedure `memq` that searches a list for a given symbol and returns `false` if it is not there and returns the sublist starting with that symbol if it exists.

```
(define (memq item sequence)
  (cond ((null? sequence) false)
        ((eq? item (car sequence)) sequence)
        (else (memq item cdr sequence))))
```

```
(memq ’apple ’(pear banana prune))
false

(memq ’apple ’(x (apple sauce) y apple pear))
(apple pear)
```

- `'` is a shorthand for the procedure `quote`. So these expressions are identical:

```
('Mohamed)

(quote Mohamed)
```

### Exercise 2.53

```
(list ’a ’b ’c)
'(a b c)

(list (list ’george))
'((george))

(cdr ’((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
'((y1 y2))

(cadr ’((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
'(y1 y2)

(pair? (car ’(a short list)))
false

(memq ’red ’((red shoes) (blue socks)))
false

(memq ’red ’(red shoes blue socks))
'(red shoes blue socks)
```

### Exercise 2.54

```
(define (equal? a b)
  (cond ((and (null? a) (null? b)) true)
        ((and (symbol? a) (symbol? b)) (eq? a b))
        ((and (pair? a) (pair? b)) (if (equal? (car a) (car b))
                                       (equal (cdr a) (cdr b))
                                       false))
        (else false)))
```

## 2.3.2 Example: Symbolic Differentiation

- As an application of using symbold in our language, let's consider the problem of **symbolic differentiation**. We want to build a procedure that finds the **derivative** of a given algebraic expression with respect to a given variable. Our procedure should work like this: given the algebraic expresion `ax^2 + bx + c` and the variable `x`, it should return `2ax + b`.

- We will follow 2 strategies we have been following in modeling **rational numbers** problem which are **wishful thinking** and **data abstraction**. We will assume that we have ways of **constructung(constructors)** algebraic expresssions and **selecting(selectors)** and **testing(predicates)** their parts.

- But before starting let's scope our problem and define the derivative rules to be used by the procedure. The scope of the problem is t work with simple algebraic expressions that are either:
  - a constant (with respect to the variable)
  - the same variable
  - a sum of 2 expressions
  - a product of 2 expressions

```
dc
-- = 0  for c a constant, or a variable different from x
dx

dx
-- = 1
dx

d(u + v)   du   dv
-------- = -- + --
   dx      dx   dx

d(uv)     / dv \     / du \
----- = u | -- | + v | -- |
 dx       \ dx /     \ dx /

```

- Recall the last 2 rules (summation and product) are **recursive** in nature in the sense that a sum can be decomposed to other sums and the same applies to product.

- Now let's state needed data manipulation procedures needed without worrying how to build them. Remember, data representation is a problem by its own.

```
(constant? e v)
(same-variable? e)
(sum? e)
(addend e)
(augend e)
(make-sum a1 a2)
(product? e)
(multiplier e)
(multiplicand e)
(make-product m1 m2)
```

- Now we have everything ready to build **symbolic differentiation** procedure:

```
(define (deriv exp var)
  (cond ((constant? exp var) 0)
        ((same-variable? exp var) 1)
        ((sum? exp)
          (make-sum
            (deriv (addend exp) var)
            (deriv (augend exp) var)))
        ((product? exp)
          (make-sum
            (make-product (multiplier exp)
                          (deriv (multiplicand exp) var))
            (make-product (multiplicand exp)
                          (deriv (multiplier exp) var))))))
```

### Representing algebraic expressions

```
(define (same-variable? exp var)
  (and (symbol? exp)
       (symbol? var)
       (eq? exp var)))

(define (constant? exp var)
  (or (number? exp)
      (not (same-variable? exp var))))

(define (make-sum addend augend)
  (list '+ addend augend))

(define (sum? exp)
  (and (pair? exp)
       (eq? (car exp) 'sum)))

(define (addend exp) (cadr exp))

(define (augend exp) (caddr exp))

(define (make-product multiplier mutiplicand)
  (list '* addend augend))

(define (product? exp)
  (and (pair? exp)
       (eq? (car exp) 'product)))

(define (multiplier exp) (cadr exp))

(define (multiplicand exp) (caddr exp))
```

- Now the symbolic differentiation program is complete. We can test it:

```
(deriv ’(+ x 3) ’x)
(+ 1 0)

(deriv ’(* x y) ’x)
(+ (* x 0) (* 1 y))
```

It produces a correct answer but not an the optimal one. We need some modifications to the **constructors** or the **selectors** to reduce the result.

```
(define (make-sum addend augend)
  (cond ((=number? addend 0) augend)
        ((=number? augend 0) (addend))
        ((and (number? addend) (number? augend)) (+ addend augend))
        (else (list '+ addend augend))))

(define (make-product multiplier mutiplicand)
  (cond ((or (=number? multiplier 0) (=number? mutiplicand 0)) 0)
        ((=number? multiplier 1) mutiplicand)
        ((=number? mutiplicand 1) multiplier)
        ((and (number? multiplier) (number? mutiplicand)) (* multiplier mutiplicand))
        (else (list '* addend augend))))

(define (=number? x y) (and (number? x) (= x y)))
```

```
(deriv ’(+ x 3) ’x)
1

(deriv ’(* x y) ’x)
y
```

## 2.3.3 Example: Representing sets

- We want to represent **sets**. A **set** is a collection of unique items. This is a **mathematical** definition to **sets**. We can use **data abstraction** to define **sets** in terms of the operations that manipulate sets:

  - `union-set` computes the union of 2 sets that is the set that contains all elements that exist in any of the 2 sets.
  - `intersection-set` computes the intersection of 2 sets that is the set that contains all elements that exist in both sets.
  - `element-of-set?` a predicate that determines whether an item is an element of the set.
  - `adjoin-set` computes the set that contains all elements of the given set as well as the given item.

- Let's examine multiple represetnations for sets and compare the performance of operations of each.

### Sets as unordered lists

- The naive approach to representing sets is using lists in which we do not care about order:

```
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond ((null? set) false)
        ((equal? (car set) x) true)
        (else (element-of-set? x (cdr set)))))
```

```
(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (if (element-of-set? x set)
      set
      (cons x set)))
```

```
(define (intersetion-set set1 set2)
  (cond ((or (null? set1) (null? set2)) '())
        ((element-of-set? (car set1) set2)
          (cons (car set1)
                (intersetion-set (cdr set1) set2)))
        (else (intersetion-set (cdr set1) set2))))
```

```
(define (union-set set1 set2)
  (cond ((null? set1) (set2))
        ((null? set2) (set1))
        ((element-of-set? (car set1) set2)
          (union-set (cdr set1) set2))
        (else (cons (car set1)
                    (union-set (cdr set1) set2)))))
```

- Now let's discuss the efficiency(performance) of implementing sets as unordred lists:

  - `element-of-set` might need to scan the entire list to find an element so the worst case scenario is `O(n)`.
  - `adjoin-set` is defined in terms of `element-of-set` so its worst case scenario is `O(n)` as well.
  - `intersetion-set` and `union-set` iterate over one list and for each element they iterate over the second list so their worst case scenario is `O(n^2)`.

- Since `O(n^2)` is a very bad performance then we have to find a better one.

### Sets as ordered lists

- A considerable performance improvement we can get is by representing **sets** as **ordered lists** in an increasing order.

- To build `element-of-set`, no need to scan the entire list. If the item you're looking for is less than a given element of the set then it can not be found in the rest of the list since all subsequent elements are larger than the current one.

```
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond ((null? set) false)
        ((equal? (car set) x) true)
        ((> (car set) x) false)
        (else (element-of-set? x (cdr set)))))
```

This is still `O(n)` in the worst case scenario but at average we will have to scan half of the list instead of the full list.

- `adjoin-set` will still have `O(n)` in the worst case scenario.

```
(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (cond ((null? set) '(x))
        ((equal? x (car set)) set)
        ((< (car set) x)
          (cons (car set)
                (adjoin-set x (cdr set))))
        (else (cons x set))))
```

- For `intersection-set` we can adapt a very smart approach that make good use of the order. We can go over the 2 lists at the same time, check if the 2 elements of ths 2 lists are equal then we have an element of the intersection. If one is less than the other then this one can ot be found in the other list then we can decrease the problem by one and go. This will end up with number of steps `2n` which is `O(n)`. This is far more efficient than `O(n^2)`.

```
(define (intersection-set set1 set2)
  (if (or (null? set1) (null? set2))
      '()
      (let ((x1 (car set1)) (x2 (car set2)))
        (cond ((= x1 x2) (cons x1 (intersection-set (cdr set1) (cdr set2))))
              ((< x1 x2) (intersection-set (cdr set1) set2))
              (else (intersection-set set1 (cdr set2)))))))
```

- We an apply the sam smart approach for `union-set` and get the same perfromance optimization.

````
(define (union-set set1 set2)
  (cond ((null? set1) set2)
        ((null set2) set1)
        (else (let ((x1 (car set1)) (x2 (car set2)))
                (cond ((= x1 x2) (cons x1 (union-set (cdr set1) (cdr set2))))
                      ((< x1 x2) (cons x1 (union-set (cdr set1) set2)))
                      (else (cons x2 (union-set set1 (cdr set2)))))))))
```
````

### Sets as Binary trees

- We can go further and represent sets as **binary trees** in which any **node entry** is larger than all elements in the its left subtree and smaller than all elements in its right subtree.

- By this, to search for an item `element-of-set?`, at each step you compare the item you're looking for with the node entry, if they are the same then you're done, if the item is less than the node entry then you can ignore the entir right subtree and search in the left one, if it is larger then you can ignore the entire left subtree and search in the right subtree.

- Since at each step we reduce the problem by half(when the tree is balanced) then the runtime of this algorithm is `O(lgn)` and this is a significant improvement over `O(n)`.

- Let's represent sets as trees:

```
(define (make-tree entry left right)
  (list entry left right))

(define (entry tree)
  (car tree))

(define (left-branch tree)
  (cadr tree))

(define (right-branch tree)
  (caddr tree))
```

- Let's build `element-of-set?` procedure:

```
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond ((null? set) false)
        ((= x (entry set)) true)
        ((< x (entry set)) (element-of-set? x (left-branch set)))
        (else (element-of-set? x (right-branch set)))))
```

- Let's build `adjoin-set` procedure:

```
(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (cond ((null? set) (make-tree x '() '()))
        ((= x (entry set)) set)
        ((< x (entry set))
          (make-tree
            (entry set)
            (adjoin-set x (left-branch set))
            (right-branch set)))
        (else
          (make-tree
            (entry set)
            (left-branch set)
            (adjoin-set x (right-branch set))))))
```

This procedure also has `O(lgn)` runtime.

- All these claims are based on an assumption that the tree is balanced but we might end up with an unbalanced tree after a number of `adjoin-set` operations even when starting with a balanced one. We can solve this by building a procedure that restructure an arbitrary tree into a balanced one and apply this procedure after every a few `adjoin-set` operations.
