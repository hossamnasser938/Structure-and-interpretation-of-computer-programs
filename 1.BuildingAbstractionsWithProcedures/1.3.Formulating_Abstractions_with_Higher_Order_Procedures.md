# 1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures

- So far we used **Procedure definition** as a means of **abstraction**. Procedures that accept and return numbers are very useful to define abstractions for computing things like computing the `square` of a number for example. We can go beyond that and instead of building abstractions that do computation of some sort, we can build **abstractions** for **patterns** of computation. This type of abstraction does not compute something but instead generates other procedures that are instances of patterns of computation. These procedures that model patterns of computation are possible because procedures can accept other procedures as argument and also return other procedures as values and they are called **higher-order procedures**.

## 1.3.1 Procedures as Arguments

- Look at these 3 procedures for computing the sum of:

  - integers from a and b

  ```
  (define (sum-integers a b) (
      if (> a b)
         0
         (+ a (sum-integers (+ a 1) b))
  ))
  ```

  - odd integers from a and b

  ```
  (define (sum-odd-integers a b) (
      if (> a b)
         0
         (+ (if (even? a) 0 a) (sum-integers (if (even? a) (+ a 1) (+ a 2)) b))
  ))
  ```

  - cubes of integers from a and b

  ```
  (define (sum-cubes a b) (
      if (> a b)
         0
         (+ (cube a) (sum-cubes (+ a 1) b))
  ))
  ```

- These 3 procedures capture a common pattern. A more general pattern for summing things. We can identify the pattern by capturing the fixed and variable slots between the 3 procedures:

```
(define (name a b) (
      if (> a b)
         0
         (+ (term a) (name (next a) b))
  ))
```

- This is a good chance to introduce abstraction for the pattern and use it to generate instances of the general sum pattern:

```
(define (sum term a next b) (
      if (> a b)
         0
         (+ (term a) (sum (next a) b))
  ))
```

```
(define (sum-integers a b) (
    (define (term a) a)
    (define (next a) (+ a 1))
    (sum term a next b)
))
```

```
(define (sum-odd-integers a b) (
    (define (term a) (if (even? a) 0 a))
    (define (next a) (if (even? a) (+ a 1) (+ a 2)))
    (sum term a next b)
))
```

```
(define (sum-cubes a b) (
    (define (term a) (cube a))
    (define (next a) (+ a 1))
    (sum term a next b)
))
```

### Exercise 1.29

Simpson's Rule for integration

```
(define (simpson-integration f a b n)
  (define h (/ (- b a) n))

  (define (simpson-integration-sum f a b n k) (
    if (> k n)
       0
       (+ (* (cond ((or (= k 0) (= k n)) 1)
                   ((even? k) 2)
                   (else 4))
             (f (+ a * k h))
          (simpson-integration-sum f a b n (+ k 1)))
  ))

  (* (/ h 3) (simpson-integration-sum f a b n k)))
```

### Exercise 1.30

Iterative sum procedure

```
(define (sum term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (iter (next a) (+ (term a) result))))
  (iter a 0))
```

### Exercise 1.31

a. product procedure (recursive)

```
(define (product term a next b) (
      if (> a b)
         1
         (* (term a) (product (next a) b))
  ))
```

- Factorial procedure defined in terms of product procedure

```
(define (factorial x)
  (define (inc y) (+ y 1))
  (define (identity z) z)
  (product identity 1 inc x))
```

b. product procedure (iterative)

```
(define (product term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (iter (next a) (* (term a) result))))
  (iter a 1))
```

## 1.3.2 Constructing Procedures Using Lambda

- It makes no sense to define a procedure and associate it with a name to just pass it as a parameter to another procedure. Instead we can use `lambda` expression which is used to create a procedure withou the need to associate that procedure with a name(you still can associate it with a name if you need).

- So instead of defining the `sum-integers` procedure like this:

```
(define (sum-integers a b)
  (define (term a) a)
  (define (next a) (+ a 1))
  (sum term a next b))
```

We can use `lambda` expression:

```
(define (sum-integers a b)
  (sum (lambda (x) x) a (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) b))
```

- The syntax of `lambda` expression is:

```
(lambd (<formal-parameters>) <body>)
```

- `lambda` is just an expression that creates procedures so these are identical:

```
(define (inc n) (+ n 1))
```

```
(define inc (lambda (n) (+ n 1)))
```

Actually the first is the special case not the latter and the first also is syntactic sugar. Because `define` used to associate values with names in the environment and its general syntax is:

```
(define <name> <value>)
```

Notice it is not:

```
(define (<name>) <value>)
```

The way we use `define` to define a procedure is a special case:

```
(define (<procedure-name> <formal-parameters>) <body>)
```

and this is equivalent to:

```
(define <procedure-name> (lambda (<forma-parameters>) <body>))
```

- We can use `lambda` expression exactly as we use names that represent procedures. So these are identical:

```
(define (inc n) (+ n 1))
(inc 1)
2
```

```
((lambda (n) (+ n 1)) 1)
2
```

### Using `let` to create local variables

- It's a given that defining **local variables** is a valuable utility. Suppose we wish to create a procedure that computes the function:

```
f(x,y) = x(1 + xy)^2 + y(1 - y) + (1 + xy)(1 - y)
```

This function can simplified to:

```
f(x,y) = xa^2 + yb + ab
```

where:

```
a = 1 + xy
b = a - y
```

In this case, the ability to define **local variables** will let us simplify the procedure. We can define **local variables** using `define`:

```
(define (f x y)
  (define a (+ 1 (* x y))
  (define b (- 1 y))
  (+ (* x (square a))
     (* y b)
     (* a b)))
```

However, later we will see that this is not the best approach.

- We can define inner procedure that captures those **local variables** as formal parameters:

```
(define (f x y)
  (define (f-helper a b)
    (+ (* x (square a))
       (* y b)
       (* a b)))
  (f-helper (+ 1 (* x y))
            (- 1 y)))
```

- We can also use `lambda` expression to capture those **local variables** as formal parameters:

```
(define (f x y)
  ((lambda (a b)
      (+ (* x (square a))
         (* y b)
         (* a b)))
    (+ 1 (* x y))
    (- 1 y))
```

- **LISP** has a special syntax for this using `let` keyword:

```
(define (f x y)
  (let ((a (+ a (* x y)))
        (b (- a y)))
    (+ (* x (square a))
       (* y b)
       (* a b))))
```

- `let` basic syntax is:

```
(let ((<var-1> <exp-1>)
      (<var-2> <exp-2>)
      (<var-n> <exp-n>))
  <body>)
```

It lets you define var-exp pairs and use them immediately inside its body. This is just a syntactic sugar over `lambda` expression:

```
((lambda (<var-1> <var-2> <var-n>)
    <body>)
  <exp-1>
  <exp-2>
  <exp-n>)
```

- Recall that **variables** defined using `let` is **local** to its **body**. Look at this:

```
(define (f a)
  (let ((a 3)
        (b (+ a 4)))
    (* a b)))

(f 5)
```

In the first look you may assume that `(f 5)` evaluates to `21`. However, this is not correct. `(f 5)` evaluates to `60`. This is because when `a` is used inside the expression of the **local variable** `b`, it has the outer value `5` not the local(to `let`) one `3`. Because `a` equals `3` only in the **body** of `let`. Otherwise it has the outer value which is `5`

### Exercise 1.34

```
(f f)
(f 2)
(2 2)
```

will fail since `2` is not a procedure.

## 1.3.3 Procedures as General Methods

- With **higher-order procedures**, we could express **general methods of computation** like `sum` procedure defined before. In this section we cover 2 extra examples of the same idea:

  1. **Finding roots of equations using the half-interval method**

  - Finding the roots of equations(continous functions) means finding the values at which the function value is zero. So for the function `f(x) = x`, the roots are `{0}` since `f(0) = 0`.
  - The **half-interval** method can be used to find the roots. It states that: if we're given an interval of 2 values `a` and `b` such that `f(a) < 0 > f(b)`, certainly there is a value `x` such that `a < x > b` and `f(x) = 0`. Based on that fact, we can get `midpoint = average(a, b)` and if `f(midpoint) > 0` then we rerun the same algorithm with the interval `a, midoint`, if `f(midpoint) < 0` then we rerun the same algorithm with the interval `midoint, b`, and if `f(midpoint) = 0` then the `midpoint` is the root. We keep iterate until the 2 intervals are close enough.

  ```
  (define (search f a b)
    (let ((midpoint (average a b))
      (if (close-enough? a b)
          midpoint
          (let ((test-val (f midpoint)))
            (cond ((positive? test-val) (search a midpoint))
                  ((negative? test-val) (search midpoint b))
                  (else midpoint))))))
  ```

  ```
  (define (close-enough? x y)
       (< (abs (- x y)) 0.001))
  ```

  ```
  (define (half-interval-method f a b)
       (let ((a-value (f a))
             (b-value (f b)))
         (cond ((and (negative? a-value) (positive? b-value))
                (search f a b))
               ((and (negative? b-value) (positive? a-value))
                (search f b a))
               (else
                (error "Values are not of opposite sign" a b)))))
  ```

  2. **Finding fixed points of functions**

  - Finding a **fixed-point** of a function `f(y)` is finding a value `y` such that `f(y) = y`. We can find the fixed-point by starting with a guess and keep improving the guess through applying the function itself untill the guesses are close enough.

  ```
  (define (fixed-point f guess)
    (let ((new-guess (f guess)))
         (if (close-enough? new-guess guess)
              new-guess
              fixed-point f new-guess)))
  ```

  - Finding a **fixed-point** of a function can be used to calculate **square roots**. Since square root of a value `x` is another value `y` such that `y^2 = x` === `y = x / y`, we can look at the problem from the perspective that we are finding **fixed-point** to the function `f(y) = x / y`. However, the previous `fixed-point` procedure does not converge for the function `f(y) = x / y` since starting with a guess `y1`, the next guess is `y2 = x / y1`, the next guess is `x / y2` === `x / (x / y1)` === `y1`, and the guesses will keep oscilating between `x / y1` and `y1`. One way to prevent this oscilation, is to prevent the guess from changing so much since the answer is always between `x` and `x / y`, we can improve the guess by averaging `y` and `x / y`. We find ourselves finding the fixed-point of the function `f(y) = 1/2 (y + x / y)` which is a straightforward transformation to the function `f(y) = x / y`(Just add `y` to the two sides and then divide by 2).

  ```
  (define (sqrt x)
    (fixed-point ((lambda y) (/ (+ y (/ x y)) 2)) 1.0))
  ```

## 1.3.4 Procedures as Returned Values

- The ability to accept procedures as arguments increased the expressive power of the language massively. We could model general methods of computation. We can go beyond that and build procedures that themselves return other procedures. Pick the **average damp** mechanism introduced in the previous section which helped us reformulate `sqrt` procedure in terms of `fixed-point` procedure. **Average damp** itself is a general idea that we can capture in a procedure definition and use it to build more abstractions:

```
(define (average-damp f)
  (lambda (x)
    (average x (f x))))
```

We can use it to build `sqrt` procedure. It's the same one we built before but now it clearly expresses itself.

```
(define (sqrt x)
    (fixed-point ((average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x y))) 1.0))
```

We can also use it to build `cube-root` procedure:

```
(define (cube-root x)
  (fixed-point (average-damp (lambda (y) (/ x (square y))) 1.0)))
```

### Newton's method

### Abstractions and first-class procedures

- **LISP**, unlike other programming languages, grants **procedures** full first-class status which means it lets **procedures**:

  - named by a variable
  - passed as an argument to a procedure
  - returned as value from a procedure
  - included in data structures

- This full first-class status comes with an implementation cost. I will try to illustrate this cost:
  - memory consists of multiple sections including:
    - text(code) => where executable code is stored
    - heap => any data
    - stack => currently executing procedure and its variables
  - stack memory is much fast but small in size
  - if procedures are granted first-class status, then they can be arguments to a procedure for example then they can be stored in stack memory and recall that stack memory is small in size
