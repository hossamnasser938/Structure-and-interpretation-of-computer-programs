# 2.2 Hierarchical Data and the Closure Property

- A mechanism of combining data objects satisfies the **closure property** if the elements resulted from such combination mechanism can themselves be used to combine more complex elements using the same mechanism.
- The word **closure** comes from **abstract algebra** where a **set** of elements is said to be **closed** under an operation if applying this operation to an element of the set produces another element of the set.
- The power of `cons` in **LISP** comes from the fact that we can constuct a **pair** whose `car` and `cdr` can be **pairs** hence it satisfies the **closure property**.
- The power of the **closure property** is that it permits building hierarchical data in which a data object is composed of parts and the parts are themselves composed of parts.
- We already used the **closure property** when we introduced the **combination** since the elements of a **combination** can themselves be other **combinations**.

## 2.2.1 Representing Sequences

- A **sequence** is an ordered list of items.
- There are many ways to represent sequences using `cons` but we will stick to a conventional one. This convention represents a sequence by a chain of **pairs** where each **pair** in the chain represents an item in the sequence. Each **pair** `car` will carry the sequence item itself and `cdr` will point to the rest of the sequence. The final **pair**'s `cdr` will point to a designated value representing the end of the sequence. This value is represented by a **diagonal** in the **box and pointer notation** and the value `nil` in **LISP**. `nil` is an abbreviation for a Latin work `nihil` which means nothing.
- To represent the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4] using this convention:

```
(cons 1
      cons (2
            cons (3
                  cons (4
                        nil))))
```

- **LISP** provides a syntactic sugar for this(`list`):

```
(list 1 2 3 4)
```

- Also **LISP** pretty prints those lists:

```
(define 1-to-4 (list 1 2 3 4))
```

```
1-to-4
(1 2 3 4)
```

- selecting an item of the list is done by applying `car` and `cdr` selectors on the list

```
(car 1-to-4)
1

(cdr 1-to-4)
(2 3 4)

(cdr (cdr 1-to-4))
(3 4)

(cdr (cdr (cdr 1-to-4)))
(4)

(cdr (cdr (cdr cdr(1-to-4))))
()
```

### List Operations

- Indexing list

```
(define (list-ref items i) (
    if (= i 0)
       (car items)
       (list-ref (cdr items) (- i 1))
))
```

- Calculating list length

```
(define (length items) (
    if (null? items)
       0
       (+ 1 length cdr items)
))
```

This procedure produces a **linear recursive process**. We can write one that produces **linear iterative process**.

```
(define (length items)
  (define (length-iter items acc) (
    if (null? items)
       acc
       (length-iter (cdr items) (+ 1 acc))
  ))
  (length-iter items 0)
)
```

- Appending 2 lists

```
(define (append items1 items2) (
  if (null? items1)
     list2
     (cons (car items1)
           (append (cdr items1)
                   (items2)))
))
```

#### Exercise 2.17

```
(define (last-pair items)
  (if (null? (cdr items))
      items
      (last-pair (cdr items))))
```

#### Exercise 2.18

```
(define (reverse items)
  (define (reverse-iter items reversed)
  (if (null? items)
      reversed
      (reverse-iter (cdr items)
                    (cons (car items) reversed)))
  (reverse-iter items nil))
```

### Mapping over lists

- A common operation is to scale a list by a give factor:

```
(define (scale-list items factor) (
    if (null? items)
       nil
       (cons (* factor (car items))
             (scale-list (cdr items) factor))
))
```

- This is a common pattern in which you want to do something with the elements of a list. So there is a room here for an abstraction through a higher order procedure `map`:

```
(define (map proc items) (
    if (null? items)
       nil
       (cons (proc (car items))
             (map proc (cdr items)))
))
```

- Now we can redefine `scale` in terms of `map`:

```
(define (scale-list items factor)
(map (lambda (item) (* item factor)) items))
```

- `map` is really useful in the sense that it eables us to **separate** the parts that define the **operations to be carried out on lists** from the **way lists are combined and traversed(represented)** thus it builds **abstraction bariers** between those parts and permits changing lists representation implementation without affecting the other part.

#### Exercise 2.21

```
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons (square item) (square-list (cdr items)))))
```

```
(define (square-list items) (map square items))
```

#### Exercise 2.22

```
(define (square-list items)
  (define (square-list-iter items result)
    (if (null? items)
        result
        (square-list-iter (cdr items) (append result (list (square car items))))))
  (square-list-iter items nil))
```

## 2.2.2 Hierarchical Structures

- The fact that a pair's elements can be themselves pairs(**closure property of pairs**) lets us build hierarchical data like **trees**:

```
(cons (list 1 2) (list 3 4))
```

This construct is an example of a tree.

```
((1 2) 3 4)
    /\\
   /  |\
(1 2) 3 4
  /\
 1  2
```

Trying to calculate the `length` of such a construct will return `3`. We can implement `count-leaves` procedure to operate on trees:

```
(define (count-leaves tree)
  (cond((null? tree) 0
        (not (pair? tree)) 1)
        (else (+ (count-leaves (car tree))
                 (count-leaves (cdr tree))))))
```

- **Recursion** is a natural tool for dealing with trees since any operation on trees can be reduced to be operated on branches till reaching leaves.

### Exercise 2.24

```
(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))
(1 (2 (3 4)))
```

### Exercise 2.25

```
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr items)))))

((7))
(car (car items))

(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))
(car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr c)))))))))))))
```

### Exercise 2.26

```
(define x (list 1 2 3))

(define y (list 4 5 6))


(append x y)
(1 2 3 4 5 6)

(cons x y)
((1 2 3) 4 5 6)

(list x y)
((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
```

### Excercise 2.27

```
(define (deep-reverse items)
  (define (deep-reverse-iter items reversed)
  (if (null? items)
      reversed
      (deep-reverse-iter (cdr items)
                    (cons (if (not (pair?) (car items))
                              (car items)
                              ((deep-reverse (car items))))
                          reversed)))
  (deep-reverse-iter items nil))
```

### Exercise 2.28

```
(define (fringe items)
  (define (fringe-iter items flatten-items)
    (cond (((null? items) flatten-items)
           ((not (pair?) items) (append flatten-items
                                        (list items)))
           (else (append flatten-items
                         (append (fringe (car items))
                                 (fringe (cdr items))))))))
  (fringe-iter items nil))
```

### Mapping over trees

- As we did with lists, we need to scale a tree by a given factor. One way to do that is:

```
(define (scale-tree tree factor)
  (cond (((null? tree) nil)
         (not (pair? tree) (* tree factor))
         (else cons (scale-tree (car tree) factor)
                    (scale-tree (cdr tree) factor)))))
```

- Another way to do that is to leverage the `map` procedure that we defined to operate on lists:

```
(define (scale-tree tree factor)
  (map (lambda (sub-tree)
               (if (pair? sub-tree)
                   (scale-tree sub-tree factor))))
                   (* factor sub-tree))
       tree))
```

- This is a general technique for mapping over a tree hence there is a room for an abstraction:

```
(define (map-tree proc tree)
  (map (lambda (sub-tree)
               (if (pair? sub-tree)
                   (map-tree proc sub-tree))))
                   (proc sub-tree))
       tree))
```

Then we can redefine `scale-tree` in terms of `map-tree`

```
(define (scale-tree tree factor)
  (map-tree (lambda (leave) (* leave factor))
            tree))
```

#### Exercise 2.30

```
(define (square-tree tree)
  (map-tree square tree))
```

## 2.2.3 Sequences as Conventional Interfaces

- We saw how abstractions implemented as higher-order procedures can capture common methods of computation which increases the expressive power of our language since we can talk about not only concrete computations but also generic methods of computations. Also we saw how data objects representation affected our ability to formulate analogous operations. When we introduced sequences implemented as lists, we could build higher-order procedures that capture common operations on sequences like `map`.

- Now we're introducing another powerful design principle for working with data **the use of conventional interfaces** which will help us build much more **conceptually clear programs**.

- Let's consider 2 procedures:

  - `sum-odd-squares` which sums the squares of odd leaves of a tree:

  ```
  (define (sum-odd-squares tree)
    (cond (((null? tree) 0)
           ((not (pair? tree)) (if (odd? tree)
                                   (square tree)
                                   0))
           (else (sum-odd-squares (car tree)
                                  (cdr tree))))))
  ```

  - `even-fibs` which constructs a list of a number of even fibs:

  ```
  (define (even-fibs n)
    (define (next k)
      (if (> k n)
          nil
          (let ((f (fib k)))
               (if (even? f)
                   (cons f (next (+ k 1)))
                   (next (+ k 1))))))
    (next 0))
  ```

- These 2 procedures are very different is structure but they almost do very similar operations to reach their end goals.

  - The first one `sum-odd-squares` does the following:
    1. **enumerates** over tree leaves
    2. **filters** them selecting odd integers
    3. **computes** the `square` of these odd integers
    4. **accumulate** those squares using `+` operation starting from `0`
  - The second one `even-fibs` does the follownig:
    1. **enumerates** the integers from `0` to `n`
    2. **computes** the fib of these integers
    3. **filters** them selecting even numbers
    4. **accumulate** those even numbers using `cons` operation starting from the empty list

- A signal processing engineer can see such programs as signals flowing into stages each of which implements a step accepting a signal, doing something with it, and then passing it to the next stage till reaching the end goal.

- Unfortunately our implementation of those 2 procedures does does not avail this similarity cuz the stages above is **dispersed** over the procedure stages. For example the first procedure `sum-odd-squares` **disperses** the **enumeration** stage over the checks if the tree is `nil` and if it is a **pair** and over the recursive structure of the procedure. The same applies to the **accumulation** stage. It is **dispersed** over the **expressions** of the conditions.

- If we can structure our program to avail this similarity and goes from one stage to the next, this will result in a much concetually clear design.

### Sequence Operations

- A **signal processing system** consists of 2 distinct parts:

  - the **signals** which are well-defined things that can be accepted from a stage and filtered or transduced to another one.
  - the **stages** of transducers and filters that operate on signals.

- The key to modeling our programs as signal processing systems is to come up with those parts:

  - **the signals**: we have to agree on a **data structure** that will be accepted by stages and filtered or transduced to other instances of the same data structure to be passed to the next stage. This data structure will be acting as a **conventional interface**.
  - **the stages**: we have to implement a broad set of **procedures** that cover all possible stages.

- After preparing the data structure and the set of procedures, we can construct programs by cascading stages operating on the data structure to reach the end goal of the program.

- For this section, we will use **lists** as the **conventional interface**.
- Lets figure out what **procedures** we need in order to model the last 2 programs `sum-odd-squares` and `even-fibs` as signal processing systems:

  - For **enumeration** stage, we need 2 procedures:

    - one for enumerating over tree leaves:

    ```
    (define (enumerate-tree tree)
      (cond (((null? tree) nil)
             ((not (pair? tree)) (list tree))
             (else (append (enumerate-tree (car tree))
                           (enumerate-tree (cdr tree)))))))
    ```

    - the other for enumerating over an interval of integers

    ```
    (define (enumerate-interval low high)
      (if (> low high)
          nil
          (cons low
                (enumerate-interval (+ low 1) high))))
    ```

  - For **filtering** stage, we need a higher order procedure to filter a list based on a given predicate:

  ```
  (define (filter predicate sequence)
    (if (null? sequence)
        nil
        (if (predicate (car sequence))
            (cons (car sequence) (filter predicate (cdr sequence)))
            (filter predicate (cdr sequence)))))
  ```

  - For **computing or transforming** stage, we can use `map` procedure which we built before.

  - For **accumulation** stage, we need a higher order procedure to accumulate on a sequence using a fiven operation and an initial value:

  ```
  (define (accumulate op initial sequence)
    (if (null? sequence)
        initial
        (op (car sequence)
            (accumulate op initial (cdr sequence)))))
  ```

- Now we can rebuild our programs to exhibit this similarity as signal processing systems:

```
(define (sum-odd-squares tree)
  (accumulate +
              0
              (map square
                   (filter odd?
                           (enumerate-tree tree)))))
```

```
(define (even-fibs n)
  (accumulate cons
              nil
              (filter even?
                      (map fib
                           enumerate-interval 0 n))))
```

- The value of such programming paradigm is that the resulting programs are **modular** and **maintainable**. Also it lets us **experiment new data structure** and updating just the operations that operate on this data structure **without touching the programs** we built.

#### Exercise 2.33

```
(define (map p sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y) (cons (p x) y)) nil sequence))

(define (append seq1 seq2) (accumulate cons seq2 seq1))

(define (length sequence) (accumulate (lambda (item initial) (+ 1 initial)) 0 sequence))
```

### Nested Mappings

- Let's go further and extend sequence paradigm to include operations that are usually expressed as nested loops.
- Consider this problem: given a positive integer n, we need to come up with all pairs (i, j), where 1 <= j < i <= n, such that j + i is prime. What we can do is the following:

  1. enumerate over 1 to n
  2. for each i (1 to n), for each j(1 to i - 1), enumerate over j to i
  3. construct pair (j, i)
  4. filter those pairs selecting the ones that sum up to a prime
  5. iterate over those pairs constructing (j, i, j + i)

- Let's try to compute the first 3 steps:

```
(map
  (lamda (i)
         (map
           (lambda (j)
                   (list j i))
           (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
  (enumerate-interval 1 n))
```

The problem of this combination is that it will generate a sequence of sequences that are themselves sequences of pairs like this: when n = 3 => `((), ((1, 2)), ((1, 3), (2, 3)))`. That's not what we need. We need just a sequence of pairs. So we need to flatten the output:

```
(accumulate append
            nil
            (map
              (lamda (i)
                    (map
                      (lambda (j)
                              (list j i))
                      (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
              (enumerate-interval 1 n)))
```

Flatting is really common so we can build a dedicated procedure for it.

```
(define (flatmap proce sequence)
  (accumulate append nil (map proce sequence)))
```

Now we can simplify the above combination:

```
(flatmap
  (lamda (i)
         (map
           (lambda (j)
                   (list j i))
           (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
  (enumerate-interval 1 n))
```

- The forth step is a simple filter operation:

```
(define (prime-sum? pair)
  (prim? (+ car pair) (cadr pair)))
```

- The fifth step is a simple map operation:

```
(define (make-pair-sum pair)
  (list (car pair)
        (cadr pair)
        (+ (car pair) (cadr pair))))
```

- Now we can build the full procedure:

```
(define (prime-sum-pairs)
  (map make-pair-sum
       (filter prim-sum?
               (flatmap
                  (lamda (i)
                    (map
                      (lambda (j) (list j i))
                      (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
                  (enumerate-interval 1 n))))))
```

- Another example in which we can leverage `flatmap` is generating permutations of sets. Given the set `(1, 2, 3)` the permutations are `(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3 , 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)`. What we can do to accomplish this is that we can **reduce** the problem such that the permutations of `S` is the permutations of `S - {x}` and adjoin `x` to the fornt of each one:

```
(define (permutations s)
  (if (null? s)
      (list nil)
      (flat-map (lambda (x)
                  (map ((lambda p) (cons x p))
                       (permutations (remove x s))))
                s)))

(define (remove x s)
  (filter (lambda item)
            (not (= item x))
          s))
```

#### Exercise 2.40

```
(define (unique-pairs n)
  (flatmap
    (lamda (i)
      (map
        (lambda (j) (list j i))
        (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
    (enumerate-interval 1 n)))
```

```
(define (prime-sum-pairs)
  (map make-pair-sum
       (filter prim-sum?
               (unique-pairs n))))
```
