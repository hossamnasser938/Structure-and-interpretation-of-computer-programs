# 3.3 Modeling with Mutable Data

- Previously we described how we can build compound data objects. We also defined **data abstraction** and we used it to describe data objects. From this perspective, we can describe a data object as the set of **constructors**(to create a data object) and the set of **selectors**(to select parts of a data object).

- Now we introduced the idea of objects having changing state and modeling that using **local state** and **assignment**. Hence, **constructors** and **selectors** are not sufficient to describe such objects with changing state. We need to add a new type of operations named **mutators** with the responsibility to update such state. Such data objects are called **mutable data objects**. For example, a bank account object might require an operation to change its balance

```
(set-balance! <account> <new-balance>)
```

- We also used **pairs** as a means to glue 2 things to construct more complex constructs. So let's see how can we mutate such pairs and see how this can be a powerful tool to build much complex data structures.

## 3.3.1 Mutable List Structure

- We defined a **pair** in terms of 3 procedures `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`. We also defined lists operations like `append` in terms of these 3 operations. Now we introduce **mutators** of **pairs**:
  - `(set-car! <x> <y>)` updates `car` pointer of the pair `x` to point to `y`
  - `(set-cdr! <x> <y>)` updates `cdr` pointer of the pair `x` to point to `y`

```
(define x (cons 1 2))

(car x)
1

(cdr x)
2

(set-car! x 3)
(set-cdr! x 4)

(car x)
3

(cdr x)
4
```

```
(define a '(1 2))
(define x '(3 4))
(define y '(5 6))
(define z '(x y))

// Now z = ((3 4) 5 6)

(set-car! z a) // Now z = ((1 2) 5 6) and x is detached from the structure and can be collected by the garbage collector
```

### Exercise 3.12

```
(cdr x)
(list 'b)

(cdr x)
(list b c d)
```

### Exercise 3.13

`mystery` reverses a list

### Mutation is just assignment

- Previously we discussed how we can build **pairs** out of only procedures using **message passing** style.

```
(define (cons x y)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'car) x)
          ((eq? m 'cdr) y)
          (else error "bad argument")))
  dispatch)

(define (car p) (p 'car))

(define (cdr p) (p 'cdr))
```

- Now we can extend this representation to include mutators as well using only **assignment** and **local state**.

```
(define (cons x y)
  (define (set-x! v) (set! x v))
  (define (set-y! v) (set! y v))
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'car) x)
          ((eq? m 'cdr) y)
          ((eq? m 'set-car!) set-x!)
          ((eq? m 'set-cdr!) set-y!)
          (else error "bad argument")))
  dispatch)

(define (car p) (p 'car))

(define (cdr p) (p 'cdr))

(define (set-car! p v)
  ((p 'set-car!) v)
  p)

(define (set-cdr! p v)
  ((p 'set-cdr!) v)
  p)
```

## 3.3.2 Representing Queues

- Introducing the mutators `set-car!` and `set-cdr!` will allow us to build other data structures than the ones we built so far. The first of those data structures are **queues**.

- Simply a **queue**, as the name implies, is a fair data structure that maintains a list of item such that the first item entering the list is the first one to be accessed. This is called **FIFO**(First in first out).

```
Operation                       Resulting Queue
(define q (make-queue))
(insert-queue! q ’a)            a
(insert-queue! q ’b)            a b
(delete-queue! q)               b
(insert-queue! q ’c)            b c
(insert-queue! q ’d)            b c d
(delete-queue! q)               c d
```

- To implement a **queue**, we need to satisfy the conditions:

  - adding to a **queue** adds to the **rear**
  - deleting from a **queue** deletes from the **front**

- We can implement a **queue** as a normal list. For this case, a **queue** is just a pointer that points to the first pair of a list. When we attempt to add an item, we reach the final item and add the new item there. When we attempt to delete, we simply delete the first one of the list. However this implementation would require `O(n)` for adding a new item cuz the only way we can reach the final item is by successing cdring till the end.

- We can be smart and represent a **queue** as 2 pointers. One points to the start of the lists(**front**) and the other points to the end of the list(**rear**). By this, reaching each side of a **queue** requires `O(1)`(a time independent of the items within a **queue**).

```
(define (make-queue) (cons '() '()))

(define (front-ptr q) (car q))

(define (rear-ptr q) (cdr q))

(define (empty-queue? q) (null? (front-ptr q)))

(define (set-front-ptr! q item) (set-car! q item))

(define (set-rear-ptr! q item) (set-cdr! q item))
```

```
(define (front-queue q)
  (if (empty-queue? q)
      (error "empty queue")
      (car (front-ptr q))))
```

- To insert an item of the queue, all we have to do is:
  1. constructing a new pair for the item
  2. check first if the queue is empty, then we move fron tand rear pointers to point to this new pair
  3. otherwise, moving the cdr of the rear pair to this new pair
  4. moving the rear ptr to point to the new pair

```
(define (insert-queue! q item)
  (let ((new-pair (cons item '())))
       (cond ((empty-queue? q)
              (set-front-ptr! q new-pair)
              (set-rear-ptr! q new-pair))
             (else
                (set-cdr! (rear-ptr q) new-pair)
                (set-rear-ptr! q new-pair)
                queue))))
```

- to delete the item at the front, we simply move the front pointer to move to it cdr

```
(define (delete-queue! q)
  (if (empty-queue? q)
      (error ""empty queue)
      (set-front-ptr! q (cdr (front-ptr q))
      queue)))
```

### Exercise 3.21

```
(define (print-queue q) (start-ptr q))
```

### Exercise 3.22

```
(define (make-queue)
  (let ((front-ptr '())
        (rear-ptr '()))

  (define (empty-queue?) (null? front-ptr))

  (define (front-queue)
    (if (empty-queue?)
        (error "empty queue")
        (car front-ptr)))

  (define (insert-queue! item) (
    let ((new-pair (cons item '())))
        (cond ((empty-queue?)
               (set! front-ptr new-pair)
               (set! rear-ptr new-pair))
              (else
               (set-cdr! rear-ptr new-pair)
               (set! rear-ptr new-pair)))))

  (define (delete-queue!)
    (if (empty-queue?)
        (error "empty-queue")
        (set! front-ptr (cdr front-ptr))))

  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'empty-queue?) empty-queue?)
          ((eq? m 'front-queue) front-queue)
          ((eq? m 'insert-queue!) insert-queue!)
          ((eq? m 'delete-queue!) delete-queue!)))
  dispatch))

(define (front-queue q) ((q 'front-queue)))

(define (empty-queue? q) ((q 'empty-queue?)))

(define (insert-queue! q item) ((q 'insert-queue!) item))

(define (delete-queue! q) ((q 'delete-queue!)))
```

## 3.3.3 Representing Tables

- Previously we used **table** data structure to introduce **data directed programming** to build operations that operate on generic data. However, we did not discuss how we can build such a data structure. Now we build **table** as a mutable data object.

- Let's first discuss how we can build one-dimensional table. Consider this table:

```
a : 1
b : 2
c : 3
```

One way to implement such a data structure is as a list of records. Each record can be a pair with `key` and `value`. We will represent it using a **headed** list which is a list with the first item a special record with a symbol representing the data structure. This way we will have one place to add records without the need to return a new pointer to the list after addition.

```
(define (make-table) (list '*table*))
```

- Before adding to the table we need a way to search for a record with a given key so that when we attempt to add a new key-value pair, we look for a record with this key. If it exists then we update its associated value. If it does not exist then we add a new key-value pair.

```
(define (assoc key records)
  (cond ((null? records) false)
        ((equal? (caar records) key) car records)
        (else (assoc key (cdr records)))))
```

- Now we can use `assoc` to build the 2 main operations of the table:
  - `lookup` to get value associated with a given key if it exists
  - `insert` to insert a new record or update an existing one

```
(define (lookup key table)
  (let ((record (assoc key (cdr table))))
       (if record
           (cdr record)
           (false))))


(define (insert! key value table)
  (let ((record (assoc key (cdr table))))
       (if record
           (set-cdr! record value)
           (set-cdr! table
                     (cons (cons key value) cdr table))))
  'ok)
```

### Two-dimensional tables

- Now we tackle how to implement a two-dimensional table like this one:

```
math:
  + : 43
  - : 45
  * : 42
letters:
  a : 97
  b : 98
```

We can implement it as a table of subtables. For a subtable we use `key1` instead of the **head**.

- To construct a table, the same procedure `make-table` can be used.

- Also the same `assoc` procedure can be used to find a subtable for a given key in a table as well as a record for a given `key` in a subtable.

- To get the `value` associated with a pair of keys

```
(define (lookup key1 key2 table)
  (let
    ((subtable (assoc key1 (cdr table))))
    (if
      subtable
      (let
        ((record (assoc key2 (cdr subtable))))
        (if
          record
          (cdr record)
          false))
      false)))
```

- To insert a new value under a pair of keys

```
(define (insert! key1 key2 value table)
  (let
    ((subtable (assoc key1 (cdr table))))
    (if
      subtable
      (let
        (record (assoc key2 (cdr subtable)))
        (if
          record
          (set-cdr! record value)
          (set-cdr! subtable (cons (cons key2 value) (cdr subtable)))))
      (set-cdr! table (cons (list key1 (cons key2 value )) (cdr table))))))
```

#### Exercise 3.25

```
(define (lookup keys table)
  (if
    (null? keys)
    (error "no keys")
    (let
      ((key (car keys)) (last-key? (null? (cdr keys))))
      (if
        last-key?
        (let
          ((record (assoc key (cdr table))))
          (if
            record
            (cdr record)
            false))
        (let
          ((subtable (assoc key (cdr table))))
          (if
            subtable
            (lookup (cdr keys) subtable)
            false))))))

(define (insert! keys value table)
  (if
    (null? keys)
    (error "no keys")
    (let
      ((key (car keys)) (last-key? (null? (cdr keys))))
      (if
        last-key?
        (let
          ((record (assoc key (cdr table))))
          (cond
            (record (set-cdr! record value)
                    'ok)
          (else (set-cdr! table (list (cons key value) (cdr table)))
                'ok)))
        (let
          ((subtable (assoc key (cdr table))))
          (cond
            (subtable (insert! (cdr keys) value subtable))
            (else (set-cdr! table (cons (cons key '()) cdr table))
                  (insert! (cdr keys) value (cadr table)))))))))
```
